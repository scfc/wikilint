Abstract:
---------

wikilint (formerly Wikipedia Autoreviewer) is a web based
service to find errors (like typos and wrong formating) in
Wikipedia articles and make proposals how to improve
them. Most features work currently only for the German WP
but some are also available for English arcticles. It was
originally written by Arnim Rupp and was then published
under GPL3 license and transferred to the WP-Tool-Server and
maintained by Daniel Arnold.

Directories:
------------

* Inside the cgi-bin directory are all files needed by
  wikilint server side.

* Below the wikilint directory you can find all files needed
  by wikilint client side (browser).

* At the spider directory there is the currently unused
  spider extension which allows for batch processing
  Wikipedia articles with wikilint.
