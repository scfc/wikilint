Abstract:
---------

The Wikipedia Autoreviewer is a web based service to find errors (like typos
and wrong formating) in Wikipedia articles and make proposals how to improve
them. Most features work currently only for the german WP but some are also
available for english arcticles. It was originally written by Arnim Rupp and
was then published under GPL3 license and transferred to the WP-Tool-Server.
Futher development is done by Daniel Arnold and the community.

Directories:
------------

* Inside the cgi-bin directory are all files needed by Wikipedia Autoreviewer
server side.
* Below the wp-autoreviewer directory you can find all files needed by the
Wikipedia Autoreviewer client side (browser).
* At the spider directory there is the currently unused spider extension
which allows for batch processing Wikipedia articles with Wikipedia
Autoreviewer.
